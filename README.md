# Fireflies synchronization
simulation of the synchronization of fireflights

inspired by the webpage by Nicky Case: [Fireflies](https://ncase.me/fireflies/)

I replicate the simulation of fireflies synchronizing with netlogo, you can try it [here]()

this is a built upon the model created by Uri Wilensky also called [Fireflies](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Fireflies)
